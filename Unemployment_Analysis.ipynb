and identifying patterns based on region, time, and unemployment rate.

## Dataset
The dataset includes unemployment statistics with attributes such as:
- Region
- Date
- Unemployment Rate

- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Google Colab

## Steps Performed
1. Imported required libraries
2. Loaded unemployment dataset
3. Cleaned and preprocessed data
4. Performed exploratory data analysis (EDA)
5. Visualized unemployment trends over time
6. Compared unemployment rates across regions
7. Derived insights from visualizations

## Results
The analysis revealed significant variations in unemployment rates
across regions and time periods.

## Conclusion
This project helps in understanding how data analysis and visualization
can be used to study socio-economic trends effectively.
